This is version 0.03 of a very simple command line game I have made.
The windows .exe file can be found under the "src" directory.
If you wish to run this game on a unix-based system, you merely need to install the source code and compile the project with cargo.

Version 0.01:
Initial Game.

Version 0.02:
Minor Bug fixes.

Version 0.03:
String inputs are no longer case sensitive.
Added a few lines of dialogue to the Goblin Companion.

Version 0.04: 
Update Allows the user to replay the game upon death/completion.
